# Autoencoder_on_MNSIT-

In this project ,using the MNIST dataset ,random noise using Gaussian Noise method was added .The MNIST dataset is collection of handwritten digits from 0-9 as shown:

The encoder part of the autoencoder goes on to extract the important features of the images excluding other features ,so,at the input ,we get a noise removed image.The first image shown below is the original image to which noise is added at the step of creating the model and defining its layers.The next image is the noise removed image by the encoder of Autoencoder.
